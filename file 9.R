#find properties of data like 
#first few and last few rows
#dimensions
#no of rows and columns
#summary
#structure
#class of data

#find gender mean of marks1 and marks2

#arrange the data in the order of marks1

#who are the top 2 students from each gender from marks of subject2

#make a barplot gender distribution

#create a linear model of predicting marks1 from age

#create a logistic model to predict passfail from marks1, marks2, gender

#create a decision tree using previous case of logistic model. Predict passfail for sample case of gender, marks1, marks2

#create a decision tree - regression model : predict age on gender, marks1, marks2
